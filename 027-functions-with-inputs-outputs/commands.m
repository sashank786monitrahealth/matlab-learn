%% In this tutorial we will looking at functions with multiple inputs and outputs
%% in order to mention the outputs of a function we need to use square brackets []
%% after the reserved word of function
%% and mentione them in the square brackets
%% However, if the output is only one. Then we do not need to mention it in the square brackets
%% We just mention the output variable name without the brackets 
%% just after the reserved word of function. 

%%
%% Let me define the purpose of the function
%% The function is going to concatenate two matrices together and 
%% and then the function is going to compute different statistics 
%% such as the standard deviation 
%% variance
%% minimum value
%% maximum value of the matrices
%% and they will be returned as output of the function.

function [] = statistics_of_data(a,b)
   
end
