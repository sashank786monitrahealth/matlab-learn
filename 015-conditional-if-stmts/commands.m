%% This is brand new section of the course. This section is quite different from the previous sections.
% In the sense, that in this section we will not be merely be explaining the built in functions
% In all of the previous sections we were talking about the use of built-in functions
% for performing differnt tasks 
%% Now, since the tasks can be quite different. 
% Quite large in number and may significantly vary from one domain to another 
%% For instance, we may be interested in different set of tasks
% when we are performing signal processing. And we may be interested in a separate list of tasks
%% when we are engaged in image processing.

%% So generally speaking it is not possible for the implementers of the software to list down
%% all possible set of tasks and problems and write built in functions
%% 
%% So - in summary - sooner or later you will encounter problems for which you will not be able to find
%% a built in function - that will give you the solution. And, therefore you will have to write your own code and 
%% function to accomplish that.
