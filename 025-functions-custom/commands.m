%% add custom function code
%% the common thing in all these functions is that we will provide some inputs
%% to the functions after writing its name in smooth brackets
%% the outputs of a functions are being written before its name at the left hand side of the function
%% so that was the basic syntax of the function use.

%% now depending on the input and outputs - there can be many different types of functions 

% simplest function 
function print_function()
  disp("Hello, this is the starting function")
end
