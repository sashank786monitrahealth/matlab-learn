%% spreadsheet link helps matlab to be integrated with microsoft excel software
%% Basic motivation / Benefit of the Spreadsheet link feature is that for those
%% users who are addicted to the excel environment and they are using 
%% excel for a very long time.

%% And therefore they cannot suddenly leave that environment. 

%% So this program enables them to use and take advantage of the matlab functions
%% while still being in the excel environment. 

%% Basically, because of human psychology that we as humans resist change. 
%% And resist new things in the beginning as there are a lot of adjustments 
%% that we need to make in our daily life. 

%% So for those users who have taken years to familiarize themselves with the excel. Now moving into a 
%% totally new environment maybe a bit hard for them. 

%% So for those users, the spreadsheet link has been introduced. 

%% We will show how to setup spreadsheet link in our excel environment.
