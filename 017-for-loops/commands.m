%for loop
% most important and fundamental statement for controlling the execution flow within 
% the program
%%
%%
%%
%% By execution flow - order in which the statements are going to be executed
%%
%% For loop basically allows us to specify iterations. In particular, it allows 
%% a certain piece of code to be executed repeatedly. Since, we will be mostly be writing codes
%% which contains many statements - hence, we will include them in a script. 
%%
%% Scripts help us to organize our code and we can use them in situations when our
%% code grows in a number of statements. 
%% 
%% Essentially these are the same statements that we can run on the command line
%% But, the scripts help us to organize them in a more meaningful way
%% 
%% The basic structure for including a for loop is by mentioning the reserve word for now.

for i=1:2:10
 disp(i)
end


for i=10:-2:0
 disp(i)
end


for i=10:-1:0
 disp(i)
end
